## Build/Compile (_with GNU C++ Compiler_)

A makefile has been provided for compilation and running.

First, `cd` into the project directory

```
make build
```

_This will compile main.cpp and create a corresponding object file, which will be linked as an executable

## Run

After building/compiling, the executable must be run within the same project directory

```
./build
```

_This will initiate your program


**_\*Note:_** An executable file `program.exe` has also been provided if the user would like to skip the Build/Compile and Run steps
